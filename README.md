# screen-keylogger
I created this project out of curiosity, this is purely for entertainment and educational purposes, not to be used in any malicious intent.

this code first checks if there is an active internet connection, once that is established it will log the keystrokes and take a screenshot. you can change the parameters for how often screenshots should be taken at your convenience.

the code also handles errors such as if there is no internet connection it will wait for one to be established before logging. the other potential error might be if there is no screenshot it will retake one.
